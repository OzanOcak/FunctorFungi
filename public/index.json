[{"content":"Understanding Advanced Types in TypeScript Advanced Types TypeScript offers a robust type system that helps developers catch errors early and improve code quality. One of the powerful features of TypeScript is its advanced types, which include constructs like as const, tuples, generics, and built-in types. In this post, we’ll explore these concepts with code snippets for clarity.\nAs Const The as const assertion allows you to create immutable types. For example, while a normal variable can be mutable, using as const makes its properties read-only. This is particularly useful when creating enums or constant values.\nlet a: number = 4; // a is mutable const b = 5; // b is not mutable const c = 5 as const; // this is what actually happens behind the sceen const num = [\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3\u0026#34;] as const; // num.push(\u0026#39;4\u0026#39;) is still valid witout as const const object = { name: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, age: 35, adress: { street: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } as const; // as const make every property as read only This can be effective for creating enums:\nconst LEVELS = [\u0026#34;begginer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;intermadiate\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;advanced\u0026#34;] as const; // type LEVELS = [\u0026#39;begginer\u0026#39; | \u0026#39;intermadiate\u0026#39;| \u0026#39;advanced\u0026#39; } type Person = { skillLevel: (typeof LEVELS)[number] }; // can be assigned to variable LEVELS.forEach((level) =\u0026gt; console.log(level)); // this can be iterated unlice type Tuples Tuples are fixed-length arrays with specific types. They can be useful for representing structured data.\ntype Tuple = [string, boolean]; const person: Tuple = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, age: 35 }; Object.entries(person).forEach(([key, value]) =\u0026gt; { console.log(key, value); }); // type Tuple = [string, boolean] ,note that useState returns tupple Generics Generics enable you to create reusable components that can work with any data type. The is an example of a generic type.\nconst input = document.querySelector\u0026lt;HTMLInputElement\u0026gt;(\u0026#34;.input\u0026#34;); console.log(input); With functions, generics allow for flexibility:\nfunction getSecond\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(array: T[]): T { array[1]; } const a = [1, 2, 3]; // returns 2 (T is number) const b = [\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;b\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;c\u0026#34;]; // returns b (T is string) A practical use case for generics is in API responses:\ntype APIResponse\u0026lt;TData\u0026gt; = { data: TData; error: boolean; }; const a: APIResponse\u0026lt;Array\u0026lt;number\u0026gt;\u0026gt; = { data: [1, 2, 3], isError: false }; Async Functions TypeScript can infer return types for async functions, making code cleaner and more readable.\nfunction wait(duration: number) { return new Promise\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;((res) =\u0026gt; { setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; res(\u0026#34;hi!\u0026#34;), duration); }); } wait(1000).then((value) =\u0026gt; { console.log(value.length); }); Build in Types TypeScript provides built-in utility types like Omit, Pick, Partial, and Required to manipulate types easily.\nOmit and Pick To create a new type based on an existing one, you can use Pick or Omit:\ntype NewTodo = Pick\u0026lt;Todo, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot; | \u0026quot;completed\u0026quot;\u0026gt; type NewTodo = Omit\u0026lt;Todo, \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\ntype Todo = { id:string; name:string; completed:boolean } type NewTodo = { name:string; completed:boolean; } function saveTodo(newTodo: NewTodo) { return {...newTodo, id:crypto.randomUUID() } Partial and Required To make properties optional or required:\ntype Todo = { title?: string; completed: boolean; address?: { street?: street; }; }; type RequiredPick\u0026lt;T, Key extends keyof T\u0026gt; = Required\u0026lt;Pick\u0026lt;T, Key\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026amp; T; // we pick one of the keys from Todo type and make it required, lastly make it union with Todo but required overwrites so this code makes generic picked type as required. type FormTodo = RequiredPick\u0026lt;Todo, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;; // now title is require, it is not optional anymore type PartialPick\u0026lt;T, Key extends keyof T\u0026gt; = Partial\u0026lt;Pick\u0026lt;T, Key\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026amp; Omit\u0026lt;T, Key\u0026gt;; // we pick one key and make it partial, lastly we union with all of the keys but it would overwrite required so we omit the specific key before unioning type FormTodo2 = PartialPick\u0026lt;Todo, \u0026#34;completed\u0026#34;\u0026gt;; // now completed is optional ReturnType and Parameters TypeScript allows you to extract the return type of a function or its parameters using ReturnType and Parameters.\nconst Func = () =\u0026gt; void type ReturnTypeOfFunc = ReturnType\u0026lt;typeof Func\u0026gt; // function checkLength(a: string, b: number) { return a.length() \u0026gt; b; } type ParamsOfCheckLen = Parameters\u0026lt;typeof CheckLength\u0026gt;; // [a:string, b:number] // a tupple Record The Record type is useful for creating objects with specific keys and values.\ntype PeopleGroupByName = Record\u0026lt;Person[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;], Person[]\u0026gt;; Readonly The Readonly type creates immutable versions of existing types. This is basically same as const but readonly can be used for creating another type.\ntype FinalTodo = Readonly\u0026lt;Todo\u0026gt;; Type Narrowing Type narrowing allows for more precise type checking in your code. Basic type guards help differentiate types effectively.\nBasic Type Guards type Todo = { titles: string; property: \u0026#34;High\u0026#34; | \u0026#34;Normal\u0026#34; | \u0026#34;Low\u0026#34;; isComplete: boolean; description?: string; dueDate: Date | string; }; function extendTodo(todo: Todo) { if (typeof todo.dueDate === \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;) { // or todo.dueDate instanceof Date } else { console.log(todo.dueDate.getDate); } } checking undefined is possible with ?. Below code is equivalent to todo.description?.length \u0026gt; 5 if(todo.description !== undefined) { todo.description.length \u0026gt; 5 // length is not exist but it will not give error since we check if it is undefined but this is possible with todo.description?.length \u0026gt; 5 This ! also tell tsc that it is not possible be to be null but it overwrites typescript Discriminated Union Discriminated unions simplify handling different types:\ntype SuccessResponse = { status: \u0026#34;Success\u0026#34;; data: { id: string; name: string }; }; type ErrorResponse = { status: \u0026#34;Error\u0026#34;; errorMessage: string; }; type UserApiResponse = SuccessResponse | ErrorResponse; Function Overloads Function overloads allow you to define multiple ways to call a function based on different input types.\nfunction sum = (nums:number[]):number function sum = (a:number,b:number):number const t1 = sum([20,22]); const t2 = sum(20,22); Conclusion Understanding advanced types in TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability. By leveraging features like as const, generics, utility types, and type narrowing, developers can write more robust and error-resistant applications.

Here\u0026rsquo;s why they make a perfect couple and a tutorial on how to set up a Next.js app with a simple React user interface.\nReact and Next.js 1. Server-side Rendering (SSR): Next.js provides server-side rendering out of the box, which can improve the initial load time and search engine optimization (SEO) of your application, as opposed to a purely client-side React application.\n2. Static Site Generation (SSG): Next.js allows you to pre-render pages at build-time, creating highly performant \u0026ldquo;static\u0026rdquo; pages that can be served directly from a CDN.\n3. Routing and File-based Routing: Next.js has a file-based routing system, which makes it easy to set up and maintain the navigation structure of your application.\n4. Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits your application\u0026rsquo;s code, reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded on each page load.\n5. Image Optimization: Next.js provides built-in image optimization, which can significantly improve the performance of your application.\n6. Seamless Integration with React: Next.js is built on top of React, so you can leverage all the power and flexibility of the React ecosystem. Tutorial: Setting up a Next.js App with a Simple React User Interface\nbrew install node npx create-next-app my-app This will create a new directory called my-app with the necessary files and folders for a Next.js application.\nDevelop the React User Interface: Next.js uses the pages directory to define your application\u0026rsquo;s routes. Open the pages directory and create a new file called index.js. In this file, you can build your React user interface:\nimport React from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; const HomePage = () =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Welcome to my Next.js App\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is a simple React user interface built with Next.js.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); }; export default HomePage; Run the Development Server: In your terminal, navigate to the my-app directory and run the following command to start the development server:\nnpm run dev This will start the Next.js development server and open your application in your default web browser.\nStatic Site Generation: Create pre-rendered pages at build-time using the getStaticProps or getStaticPaths functions.\nServer-side Rendering: Render pages on the server using the getServerSideProps function.\nAPI Routes: Create serverless API routes using the pages/api directory.\nStyling: Integrate CSS, Sass, or other styling solutions into your Next.js application.\nDeployment: Deploy your Next.js app to popular hosting platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS. By combining the power of React and the features of Next.js, you can create high-performance, scalable web applications with a seamless user experience.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/building-personal-website-with-next-and-react/","summary":"I have built my personal website with Next framwork and React library, you can visit my website at oocak.com\nReact and Next.js are a great combination for building modern web applications.
