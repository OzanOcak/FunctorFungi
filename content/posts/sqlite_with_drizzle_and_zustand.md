## Drizzle

Drizzle is a popular database toolkit for building modern, fast, and type-safe database applications. It can be a great choice for setting up a SQLite database in an Expo React Native app for the following reasons:

**1- Type Safety:** Drizzle provides a type-safe API, which ensures that your database interactions are type-safe and less prone to errors. This can be especially beneficial in a React Native application, where type safety is crucial for maintaining code quality and scalability.

**2- Performance:** Drizzle is designed to be fast and efficient, which can improve the overall performance of your Expo React Native app, particularly when interacting with the database.

**3- Portability:** Drizzle supports multiple database engines, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, making it a versatile choice for your application. This allows you to easily switch between database providers if needed, without having to rewrite significant portions of your code.

```console
npx expo install expo-sqlite
expo install drizzle-orm zustand -d drizzle-kit
```
